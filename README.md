# Sudoku-Solver
Sudoku Solver in C++ created for my advanced programming module.

The Sudoku solver makes use of Naked and Hidden singles to solve sudoku puzzles.
There are five sample puzzles in the repo that are parsed by the solver and then solved.

This assignement was focused on efficiancy and aimed to solve the puzzles in as few passes as possible.

In most cases is is quicker to solve a puzzle without using Hidden singles however fewer passes are requiered when using them and some puzzles cannot be solved without them.
More complex puzzles cannot be solved at this stage.
